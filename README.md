# React Router Dom v6 Nested Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The issue involves the unexpected behavior of nested routes, where child routes might not render correctly or might lead to unexpected routing behavior.  The solution provided addresses the problem and provides a working implementation.

## Problem Description

The original code exhibits a problem where nested routes within the main App component do not render or behave as expected. The specific behavior varies depending on the routing configuration. The bug.js file shows the erroneous implementation.

## Solution

The bugSolution.js file presents a solution that correctly implements nested routes within React Router Dom v6.  The solution often involves ensuring the correct use of `Routes` and `Route` components, and carefully managing route paths.  Specific changes may include adjusting path parameters, or using different route components to create the expected hierarchical structure for the application's routing.
